We are excited to announce the launch of the Open Physics Ed website—a new home for open, accessible, and collaborative physics education!

## Why Open Physics Ed?
Open Physics Ed was created to organize and support the development of open, high-quality, and accessible resources for physics and computational science. Our mission is to lower barriers to learning and empower students, educators, and contributors everywhere.

## What’s Here Now?
- A modern, accessible, and WCAG-compliant site design
- News, updates, and community information
- A growing set of open courses, starting with [Modern Classical Mechanics](https://dannycaballero.info/modern-classical-mechanics/)
- Clear ways to get involved and contribute

## What’s Next?
We’re actively working to expand Open Physics Ed with new courses and resources, including:
- Introductory Mechanics
- Electromagnetism
- Advanced Electromagnetism
- Mathematical Methods
- (Coming soon) Quantum Physics, Modern Physics, and Statistical Mechanics

## Get Involved
Open Physics Ed is open source and welcomes contributions from everyone. Suggest new content, report issues, or submit pull requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-physics-ed/open-physics-ed-org.github.io).
