We are thrilled to announce the official launch of [Modern Classical Mechanics](https://dannycaballero.info/modern-classical-mechanics/) v0.9.2, the first major open course in the Open Physics Ed project!

## What is Modern Classical Mechanics?
Modern Classical Mechanics is a free, open-source, and accessible resource for teaching and learning classical mechanics. Developed by [Danny Caballero](https://dannycab.github.io/) and collaborators, the course provides interactive, high-quality materials for students and educators, including:
- Open textbook chapters
- Activities and homework
- Jupyter notebooks and computational resources
- Accessible, WCAG-compliant web design
- A transparent, open build process

## What's New in v0.9.2?
- **Major content updates:** New and revised chapters, activities, and notes
- **Accessibility improvements:** Enhanced navigation, keyboard support, and screen reader compatibility
- **Modern, open build system:** All materials are generated from Markdown and Jupyter, and are available in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX, LaTeX, and more)
- **Open for contributions:** Anyone can suggest changes, report issues, or submit pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics)

For full details, see the [v0.9.2 release notes](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics/blob/main/RELEASE-v0.9.2.md).

## Why Does This Matter?
This launch marks a major milestone for Open Physics Ed. Modern Classical Mechanics is the first in a series of open, accessible courses that will make high-quality physics education available to everyone. We are committed to lowering barriers, supporting collaboration, and building a more equitable future for physics education.
