    "### Skateboard Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the utility of using polar coordinates by applying it to a skateboarder moving on a circular track. In this case, the skateboarder is constrained to move along a circular path of radius $r$. Consider a skateboarder moving on that circular track as shown below:\n",

    "We can use Newton's law in polar coordinates to analyze the forces acting on the skateboarder. This is because the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface of the ramp and will only have a radial component in polar coordinates. Thus we need only decompose the gravitational force into its radial and angular components.\n",

    "The sum of all forces in the radial direction are given by:\n",

These forces are important in mechanics and can be analyzed using Lagrangian mechanics as well. They are not typically conservative forces and do not have a potential energy associated with them. \n",
