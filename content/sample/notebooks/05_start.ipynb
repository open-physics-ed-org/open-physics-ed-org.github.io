    "\n",
    "Critical to the understanding of energy is that it is a property of a system. A system can consist of a single object or be made of many different objects. In the case of modeling the motion of a single object, we often introduce the concept of a [point mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass) or [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle). A point mass is an idealized object that has mass but no size or shape. It has no internal structure and thus no internal energy. It is a useful abstraction for modeling the motion of objects in classical mechanics.\n",

    "### Kinetic Energy of a Point Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case of a point particle, we often focus on the kinetic energy of the object. The classical kinetic energy of a point mass is given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Work is a concept closely related to energy, it describes the transfer of energy from one system to another. Our definition of work is macroscopic and thus will not related to temperature. Increases in temperature are related to internal energy, and thus the micrscopic motion of the particles in a system. As we consider a point particle moving from one location to another under a given force, we can define the work done by that force as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) dx$$\n",
