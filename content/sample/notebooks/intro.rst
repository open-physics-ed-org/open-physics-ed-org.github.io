Welcome to Modern Classical Mechanics
=====================================

Modern Classical Mechanics attempts to be a modern, accessible, and interactive suite of open educational resources for teaching and learning in classical mechanics with a focus on project-based learning and computational approaches.

This site is meant to serve three main purposes:

1. **As a book-like resource** for students and educators, providing examples and explanations of classical mechanics concepts in a clear, accessible format. Here, the modern nature refers to using computing and project-based approaches to enhance understanding, rather than traditional lecture formats.
2. **As a collection of activities** that can be used in the classroom or for self-study with links to relevant resources, simulations, and other materials.
3. **As an open source project** that welcomes contributions from students, educators, and developers to improve and expand the resources available. By reproducing this kind of content in an accessible, web-based format, we aim to make it easier for anyone to learn and teach physics, regardless of their background or resources.

How to Use This Site
--------------------

* **Students:** Use the resources, activities, and simulations to enhance your understanding of classical mechanics concepts. You can also contribute by suggesting improvements or adding new content.
* **Educators:** Use the materials to supplement your teaching, create new activities, or adapt existing ones for your classroom. You can also contribute by sharing your own resources or providing feedback on the site.
* **Developers:** Contribute to the project by improving the site's design, functionality, or accessibility. You can also help by adding new features or fixing bugs.

How to Contribute
