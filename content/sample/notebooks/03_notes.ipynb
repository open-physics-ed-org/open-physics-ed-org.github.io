    "# Week 3 - Notes: Making Classical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The central enterprise of physics is making and testing models of physical systems. These models we developed are based on the assumptions we make about the physical systems we are studying. As we characterize the system, we make simplifying assumptions that allow us to describe the system in terms of a few key quantities. These quantities are often called the [\"degrees of freedom\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)) of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Classical Mechanics, we will use formulations of physics, such as [Newton's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion), to describe the motion of particles. We can also use the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) and [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics) formulations of mechanics. These formulations are mathematical expressions of the physical laws that govern the motion of particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, those expressions are [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) that describe how the system evolves in time. Our work in classical mechanics is to develop techniques and tools that let us investigate the solutions to these equations. These differential equations are commonly called [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion) (EOM). An equation of motion describes the evolution of the agents (particles) as they interact with their surroundings and each other."

    "## Newtonian Examples of Classical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "From a Newtonian perspective, our equations of motion are often second-order differential equations. This stems from the fact that Newton's second law relates the acceleration of a particle to the forces acting on it. The second law is given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec{a} = m\\ddot{\\vec{x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{x}$ is the position vector and $\\ddot{\\vec{x}}=\\frac{d^2\\vec{x}}{dt^2}$ is the acceleration vector. Thus, Newton's second law is a general EOM that describes the dynamics of a particle of mass, $m$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2\\vec{x}}{dt^2} = \\dfrac{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} What is Dynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamics is the study of the time evolution of a system in question. In classical mechanics, dynamics is the study of the motion of particles and the forces that cause that motion. In other physics, dynamics can refer to the study of the evolution of a system in time and space. And here, space might be an abstraction, such as a [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space). We study phase spaces later in the term.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will spend a lot of time studying the [simple harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator) (SHO) in this course. The SHO is a system that oscillates back and forth around an equilibrium position. It is a very common system in physics and is used a base model for many more complex systems. Consider a mass, $m$, attached to a spring with spring constant, $k$, sitting on a frictionless horizontal plane as in the figure below.\n",

    "## Turning Observations into Models\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more challenging aspects of physics is how we work to make models of the observations we have. This a long and challenging process in general, but if we have a general schematic, we can make progress. The hand drawn figure below provides such a schematic.\n",

    "![Framework for making models](../images/notes/week3/prelim_framework.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the schematic, our observations are the starting point. Using our framework for physics (e.g., Newton's Laws) and making the appropriate assumptions (in blue), we can develop a model (in red) of the system. By conducting analysis and investgating the evolution of the model, we produce predictions (in green). We can then compare tose predictions to our observations to evaluate how well our model describes the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we mostly focus on the elements circled in purple where we develop models, and use them to predict. The core part of this class is the orange circled elements of modeling and predicting. We will spend a lot of time developing the tools and techniques to make these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Making models of physical systems is greatly helped by considering the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the phenomenon or system of interest.\n",
    "- Identify the interactions the system has with its surroundings.\n",
    "- Choose an appropriate physics framework to investigate the system (Newton? Lagrange? Hamilton? Continuous or Discrete?).\n",
    "- Sketch the system and identify the interactions, name them, and assign them to the appropriate framework.\n",
    "- Choose your coordinate system and define your variables.\n",
    "- Apply the appropriate physics framework to the system.\n",
    "- **Obtain the equations of motion**, and make predictions.\n",

    "### Example: Falling Ball in 1D\n",

    "![FBD of a falling ball with air resistance](../images/notes/week3/1d-ball-fbd-air.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, we have identified the forces acting on the ball. We have the gravitational force, $W = mg$, and the air resistance, $F_{\\text{air}}$. We have chosen the linear mode for air-resistance, which is a choice of model given the assumption that the ball moves very slowly -- *this is not a good assumption in this case*, but makes the mathematical analysis simpler.\n",
