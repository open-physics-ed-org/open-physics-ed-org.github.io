So, you will be responsible for developing a plan for your final project, and the timeline under which you will accomplish it. Our job is to provide feedback and guidance on your plan, and to offer support in the development and construction of your final project.\n",

Consider making a [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) to help you plan your project. This is a useful tool for planning and tracking your progress.

You need to explain the motivation, the physics background, the approach, and the timeline in a way that is compelling and clear.\n",
