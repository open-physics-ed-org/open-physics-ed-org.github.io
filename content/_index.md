# Welcome to Open Physics Ed

Open Physics Ed is a collaborative, open-source project dedicated to building accessible, high-quality, and modern educational resources for physics and computational science. Our mission is to lower barriers to learning by providing free, open, and adaptable materials for students, educators, and lifelong learners everywhere.

## What We Offer
- **Accessible, open resources** for physics and computational science
- **Modern, semantic, and screen-reader-friendly design**
- **Collaborative development**â€”anyone can contribute
- **Free to use, modify, and distribute**

## Courses and Materials
We are actively developing and deploying resources for:

- **Introductory Mechanics**
- **Electromagnetism**
- **Classical Mechanics** (see [Modern Classical Mechanics](https://open-physics-ed-org.github.io//modern-classical-mechanics/))
- **Advanced Electromagnetism**
- **Mathematical Methods**

In the future, we plan to expand to:

- **Quantum Physics**
- **Modern Physics**
- **Statistical Mechanics**

## Our Philosophy
Open Physics Ed is guided by the following principles:
1. **Openness:** All materials are open source and free to use, modify, and distribute.
2. **Accessibility:** We strive to meet and exceed accessibility standards, ensuring our resources are usable by everyone.
3. **Collaboration:** We welcome contributions from students, educators, developers, and the broader community.
4. **Simplicity:** Our sites and materials are intentionally simple and easy to use, modify, and distribute.
