Open Physics Education is a community dedicated to making physics accessible and engaging for learners at all levels.

## Our Mission

We believe physics education should be:

- **Open** – Free and openly available to everyone
- **Accessible** – Clear explanations and multiple learning approaches
- **Community-driven** – Built by educators and physicists for educators and physicists
- **Quality** – Rigorous content with real-world applications

## What We Do

We create and curate:

- **Course materials** – Lecture notes, problem sets, and activities
- **Teaching resources** – Lab manuals, simulations, and pedagogical guidance
- **Research** – Evidence-based practices for physics education
- **Tools** – Software and resources to support learning

## Philosophy

Physics is for everyone. We believe that clear communication, interactive learning, and community support can help all students develop deep understanding of physics concepts.
