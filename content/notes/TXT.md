# TXT Pipeline Needed

We need to build a pipeline for converting content pages to plain TXT format as part of the OERForge static site generator. This should:
- Integrate with the existing conversion logic and database tracking.
- Support all content types (Markdown, Jupyter, DOCX, etc.)
- Ensure TXT output is accessible and WCAG compliant.
- Add dynamic download buttons for TXT once implemented.

A GitHub issue will be created to track this feature request and its implementation.
