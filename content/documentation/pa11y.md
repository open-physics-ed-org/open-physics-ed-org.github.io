# pa11y.py â€” OERForge Accessibility Batch Runner

## Overview

`pa11y.py` is a command-line utility for running automated accessibility checks on all HTML files in the OERForge build directory using Pa11y. It loads configuration from YAML, validates required files and directories, and orchestrates the batch checking and reporting workflow. This script is designed for new users and programmers to provide a simple, robust entry point for accessibility validation.

- **Loads Pa11y and site configuration from YAML**
- **Validates existence of build directory, config file, and database**
- **Runs accessibility checks on all HTML files using Pa11y**
- **Uses custom config and WCAG level from YAML**
- **Handles errors and missing files gracefully**
- **Integrates with OERForge reporting and badge generation**
