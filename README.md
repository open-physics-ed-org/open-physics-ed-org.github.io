# Open Physics Education

Welcome to Open Physics Education, a community dedicated to making physics accessible and engaging for learners at all levels.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains the source code for the [Open Physics Education website](https://openphysicsed.org/), showcasing resources, courses, and tools created for physics educators and learners. The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for clean, modern design.

- **Website:** https://openphysicsed.org/
- **Content:** Course materials, teaching resources, news, and project information
- **Audience:** Educators, students, and developers interested in open physics education

## 🧭 Structure

- `content/` — All website content
  - `about.md` — Mission, philosophy, and how to get involved
  - `posts/` — News, announcements, and updates
- `static/` — Images, logos, and static assets
- `themes/` — Hugo theme (PaperMod)
- `public/` — Generated static site (built by Hugo)
- `hugo.toml` — Hugo configuration and site metadata
- `.github/workflows/` — Automated build and deployment

## 🎓 Our Mission

We believe physics education should be:

- **Open** – Free and openly available to everyone
- **Accessible** – Clear explanations and multiple learning approaches
- **Community-driven** – Built by educators and physicists for educators and physicists
- **Quality** – Rigorous content with real-world applications

## 📖 What We Offer

- **Course materials** – Lecture notes, problem sets, and activities
- **Teaching resources** – Lab manuals, simulations, and pedagogical guidance
- **Research** – Evidence-based practices for physics education
- **Tools** – Software and resources to support learning

## 🚀 Building the Site

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To build and serve locally:

```sh
hugo server
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313/`.

To build for production:

```sh
hugo
```

This generates the static site in the `public/` directory.
