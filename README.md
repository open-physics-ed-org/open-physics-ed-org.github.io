# Welcome to Open Physics Ed dot Org! ðŸš€

*Open Physics Ed* is a fun, friendly, and community-powered static site for sharing open physics education resources, news, and more. No Hugo, no Jekyll, no magic SSGsâ€”just pure Python and a sprinkle of creativity!

## What Makes This Site Special?

- **Handcrafted Python Build**: Forget the static site generator hype. This project uses a custom Python script (`build.py`) to turn Markdown and YAML into a beautiful, accessible website.
- **Markdown Content**: All your pages and news live in `content/` and are organized by `_content.yml`.
- **Accessible by Design**: Color schemes, navigation, and our stylish logo are all WCAG-compliant.
- **Easy to Hack**: Want to add a page? Just drop a Markdown file in `content/` and update `_content.yml`.
- **No Server Needed**: Open `docs/index.html` in your browser and enjoy!
- **VS Code Friendly**: Comes with a build task that uses your Python virtual environment for smooth, reproducible builds.

docs/news/            # News articles
docs/about/           # About page
docs/css/             # CSS for the site
docs/images/          # Logo, etc.

# VS Code build task:
.vscode/tasks.json    # Runs `.venv/bin/python3 build.py` for you
```

## How Do I Build This Thing?

To set up your environment automatically, run:

```sh
python3 setup.py
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment in `.venv` if it doesn't exist
- Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`

After setup, activate the environment:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then build the site:

```sh
python build.py
```

Your site will be ready in `docs/index.html`.

Check out [`BUILD.MD`](BUILD.MD) for a fun, step-by-step guide to setting up your environment and building the site. Spoiler: it's just a couple of commands!
