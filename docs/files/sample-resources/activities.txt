Activities

Welcome to the activities page! Here you'll find interactive and hands-on exercises to deepen your understanding of modern classical mechanics.

Sample Activity: Pendulum Lab

Objective: Explore the motion of a simple pendulum and measure its period.


Materials: String, weight, stopwatch, ruler.


Instructions:

Set up a pendulum of known length.


Displace it by a small angle and release.


Measure the time for 10 oscillations.


Calculate the period and compare with theory.



Tip: Try different lengths and plot period vs. length!

Sample Activity: Energy Skate Park (PhET)

Objective: Investigate conservation of energy using a virtual skate park.


Link: PhET Energy Skate Park


Instructions:

Open the simulation and build a track.


Observe kinetic and potential energy as the skater moves.


Experiment with friction and track shapes.
