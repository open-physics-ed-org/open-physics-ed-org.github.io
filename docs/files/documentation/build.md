# build.py â€” OERForge Build Orchestrator

## Overview

`build.py` is the main workflow orchestrator for the OERForge static site generator. It coordinates the entire build process, including database initialization, content scanning, conversion, HTML generation, exporting, and deployment preparation. This script is designed for new users and programmers to provide a clear, step-by-step build pipeline for open educational resources.

- **Initializes the content database**
- **Scans the table of contents and populates the database**
- **Converts all source content to output formats**
- **Exports all content and assets to the build directory**
- **Builds HTML pages and section indexes**
- **Copies build outputs to docs/ for publishing**
- **Logs all major steps and errors**
