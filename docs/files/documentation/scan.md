# `scan.py` â€” OERForge Static Site Asset and Content Scanner

## Overview

`scan.py` provides the core logic for scanning site content, extracting assets, and populating the SQLite database for the OERForge project. It supports hierarchical TOC parsing, asset extraction from Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and DOCX files, and maintains relationships between pages, sections, and files. The module is designed for clarity, extensibility, and ease of debugging, with standardized logging and comprehensive docstrings.

## Module Docstring

```python
"""
scan.py
--------
Static Site Asset and Content Scanner

This module provides functions for scanning site content, extracting assets, and populating the SQLite database
with page, section, and file records. It supports Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and DOCX files, and maintains
hierarchical relationships from the Table of Contents (TOC) YAML. All functions are documented and organized for
clarity and maintainability. Logging is standardized and all major operations are traced for debugging.

Key Features:
- Batch reading and asset extraction for supported file types
- Hierarchical TOC walking and database population
- Asset linking and MIME type detection
- Section and descendant queries using recursive CTEs

Usage:
    Import and call scan_toc_and_populate_db(config_path) to scan the TOC and populate the database.
    Use get_descendants_for_parent() to query section hierarchies.

---

## Typical Workflow

1. **Scan and Populate Database**
    - Call `scan_toc_and_populate_db(config_path)` to walk the TOC, read files, extract assets, and populate the database.

2. **Asset Extraction**
    - Use `batch_extract_assets` and related helpers to extract and link assets from Markdown, Notebooks, and DOCX files.

3. **Site Metadata**
    - Use `populate_site_info_from_config` to update site-wide metadata in the database.

4. **Section Hierarchy Queries**
    - Use `get_descendants_for_parent` to retrieve all children and grandchildren for a given section, supporting navigation and index pages.

---

## Logging and Debugging

All major operations are logged using `log_event`, with output to both stdout and `scan.log`. This ensures traceability for debugging and auditing. Errors, warnings, and key events are clearly marked.

---

## Extensibility

- New asset types and file formats can be added by extending the asset extraction helpers.
- The TOC walking logic supports arbitrary nesting and slug overrides.
- All functions are documented and organized for easy onboarding and contribution.

---

## Intended Audience

- Contributors to OERForge
- Developers building or extending static site generators
- Anyone needing robust asset and content scanning for static sites
