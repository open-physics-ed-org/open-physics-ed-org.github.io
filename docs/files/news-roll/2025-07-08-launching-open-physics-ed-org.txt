Launching the Open Physics Education Network

A New Home for Open Physics Course Materials

We are excited to announce the launch of the Open Physics Education Network—a new home for open, accessible, and collaborative physics education!

Why Open?

The Open Physics Education Network was created to organize and support the development of open, high-quality, and accessible resources for physics and computational science. Our mission is to lower barriers to learning and empower students, educators, and contributors everywhere.

What’s Here Now?

A modern, accessible, and WCAG-compliant site design


News, updates, and community information


A growing set of open courses, starting with Modern Classical Mechanics


Clear ways to get involved and contribute


What’s Next?

We’re actively working to expand Open Physics Ed with new courses and resources, including:

Introductory Mechanics


Introductory Electromagnetism


Advanced Electromagnetism


Mathematical Methods


Introduction to Computational and Data Science


Introduction to Machine Learning for Undergraduate Physics Research


(Coming soon) Quantum Physics, Modern Physics, and Statistical Mechanics


Get Involved

The Open Physics Education Network is open source and welcomes contributions from everyone. Suggest new content, report issues, or submit pull requests on our GitHub repository.

Open Physics Ed is just getting started. Join us as we build a more accessible, equitable future for physics education!
