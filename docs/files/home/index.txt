Welcome to the Open Physics Education Network

Open Physics Education Network Logo

openphysicsed.org is a collaborative, open-source project dedicated to building accessible, high-quality, and modern educational resources for physics and computational science. Our mission is to lower barriers to learning by providing free, open, and adaptable materials for students, educators, and lifelong learners everywhere.

What We Offer

Accessible, open resources for physics and computational science


Modern, semantic, and screen-reader-friendly design


Collaborative developmentâ€”anyone can contribute


Free to use, modify, and distribute


Open-source tools, materials, and a wide variety of formats


Courses and Materials

We are actively transcribing and deploying resources for:

Introductory Mechanics


Introductory Electromagnetism


Sophomore-level Classical Mechanics (see Modern Classical Mechanics)


Junior-level Electromagnetism


Mathematical Methods


In the future, we plan to expand to:

Modern Physics


Quantum Physics


Statistical Mechanics


Community Proposed Areas


Our Philosophy

The Open Physics Education Network is guided by the following principles:

Openness: All materials are open source and free to use, modify, and distribute under non-commercial licenses.


Accessibility: We strive to meet and exceed accessibility standards, ensuring our resources are usable by everyone.


Collaboration: We welcome contributions from students, educators, developers, and the broader community.


Simplicity: Our sites and materials are intentionally simple and easy to use, modify, and distribute.
