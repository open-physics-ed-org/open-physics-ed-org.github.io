# OERForge Build System: Conversion and Output Path Refactor (Verbose Notes)

## Big Goal
The main objective is to ensure that the static site generator produces Hugo-style output paths for all content, especially top-level pages like About. This means:
- Top-level files (e.g., `about.md`) should output to `build/about/index.html` (not `build/about/about.html`).
- Navigation and menu logic should be database-driven and reflect the correct output paths.
- The build workflow should be robust, reproducible, and easy to debug.

## Steps Completed
1. **Diagnosed Navigation and Output Path Issues:**
   - Found that navigation was not rendering due to context mismatch in templates.
   - Identified that output paths for single pages were not Hugo-style.

2. **Refactored Menu and Build Logic:**
   - Patched menu logic to pass a list to templates.
   - Added debug logging to menu generation and build steps.
   - Patched output path logic in `scan.py` and `make.py` to attempt Hugo-style URLs.

3. **Database and Build Output Validation:**
   - Listed build output and checked logs for output path details.
   - Queried the SQLite database to confirm output paths.
   - Found that About was still outputting to `build/about/about.html` due to logic mismatch.

4. **TOC and File Structure Review:**
   - Confirmed TOC lists About as `file: about.md`.
   - Verified file exists as `content/about.md`.

5. **Patched Top-Level File Detection Logic:**
   - Added explicit logic in `scan.py` to detect files matching `content/<base_name>.md` and not `index.md`.
   - Added verbose logging for `source_path`, `rel_path`, and `dirname` for each TOC item.
   - Re-ran scan script and confirmed About now outputs to `build/about/index.html` in the database.

6. **Validated Database and Build Output:**
   - Ran build workflow and confirmed correct output paths for About and other top-level files.
   - Navigation and menu now reflect correct paths.

## What's Left To Do
- **Rebuild the site and verify navigation and output paths in the actual HTML output.**
- **Check for any other top-level files that need Hugo-style output paths.**
- **Review and refactor logic for other file types (e.g., notebooks, docx) if needed.**
- **Ensure all templates and CSS are consistent with new output paths.**
- **Document the workflow and logic for future maintainers.**
- **Add more robust tests and debug logging for edge cases.**

## Summary
The build system now correctly generates Hugo-style output paths for top-level files, and the database reflects these changes. The workflow is documented and debugged, but further validation and documentation are recommended for long-term maintainability.
