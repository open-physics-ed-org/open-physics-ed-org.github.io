    "One expression of a conservation law is the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy). For an isolated and closed system, the total energy is conserved. That is, before and after any process, we can account for all the energy in the system and it is the same. More generally, conservation of energy accounts for the energy \"lost\" to the surroundings. All of the changes to the system must be accounted for in changes the surroundings. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given choice of system that interacts with its surroundings, the change in energy of the system is equal to the work done on the system and any heat exchanged with the surroundings. This is a statement of the [first law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics). We can write that statement mathematically as:\n",

    "If the system does work on the surroundings, for example, by exerting a force on an external object over some displacement, then $W$ is negative because $\\Delta E_{\\text{system}}$ is negative. If instead the surroundings do work on the system, then $W$ is positive.\n",

    "\n",
    "More specifically, we often focus only on the changes to the object's motion. This is because we use often use the model of a [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle) to describe the object. In this case, the object has no internal structure and thus no internal energy. The only energy we need to consider is the object's kinetic energy, $K$. \n",

    "The total energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = T + V = K +U.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use both $T$ and $K$ to represent kinetic energy, and both $U$ and $V$ to represent potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conservation of energy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{dE}{dt} = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When all the forces are conservative, energy is conserved. Of course, we are limiting here to mechanical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conservative forces are those where the work done by the force is independent of the path taken. They have several key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The forces are functions of position only $\\vec{F}(\\vec{r})$.\n",
    "2. Their curl is zero: $\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the curl as:\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = \\begin{vmatrix}\\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ \\partial_x & \\partial_y & \\partial_z \\\\ F_x & F_y & F_z \\end{vmatrix} = \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{i} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{j} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{k}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The force is given by the negative gradient of the potential energy: $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$. This stems from the definition of the potential energy as the work done by the force.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the gradient as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F} = \\langle F_x, F_y, F_z \\rangle = -\\nabla U = -\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat{j} + \\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\hat{k}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The work done by a conservative force is path independent. We can write the work done by a conservative force as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = \\int_{C} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = -\\int_{C} \\nabla U\\cdot d\\vec{r} = -\\Delta U.$$"
