    "## Introduction to Homework 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational\n",
    "exercises deal with some motion problems and conservation of energy. We also have a preparation exercise for the upcoming midterms and final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant reading background is\n",
    "1. chapters 3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. chapters 10-13 of Malthe-Sørenssen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. for the numerical exercise see Malthe-Sørenssen section 7.5\n",
    "\n",
    "In both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. Malthe-Sørenssen's text contains also several coding examples you may find useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical homework focuses on another motion problem where you can\n",
    "use the code you developed in homework 3, almost entirely. Please take\n",
    "a look at the posted solution (jupyter-notebook) for homework 3 (**POSTED AFTER HW3 DUE**). You\n",
    "need only to change the forces at play. The numerical problem this time is based\n",
    "on your code from homework 3 and we will try to make the motion of a falling object in two dimensions more realistic by allowing to bounce up again due to a normal force from the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicalities about  homeworks and projects\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homeworks are available ten days  before the deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a **single scanned PDF document**. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Your jupyter notebook file should be converted to a **PDF** file, attached to the same PDF file as for the pencil and paper exercises. All files should be uploaded to Gradescope. \n",
