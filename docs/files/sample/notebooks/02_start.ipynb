In fact, we need a more generic approach to investigate equations of motion for systems like this. Most models of physical systems cannot be solved in closed analytical form. But, this approach to writing $N$th order differential equations as a system of $N$ first-order differential equations is a powerful tool in computational physics."

    "In this course, we will explore a broad class of problems using plotting and numerical integration as principal tools. These techniques and algorithms, along with the software we use, fall within the broader field of [scientific computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_computing). Scientific computing focuses on developing mathematical models and numerical methods to solve problems in the natural sciences and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical context, the [Timeline of the Development of Scientific Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_computing) provides an excellent overview. The roots of this field trace back to significant advancements long before modern electronic devices. Much of the foundational mathematics, such as [Euler’s Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) for solving differential equations, was developed in the 18th century by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). Implementing these algorithms on computers was a natural progression in scientific problem-solving.\n",

    "The history of scientific computing is deeply intertwined with the evolution of computing itself, a fascinating and complex narrative encompassing technical, social, political, and economic perspectives. Contributions to computing originated worldwide, starting with tools like the [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) in ancient China. Mechanical innovations such as [Pascal’s adding machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_calculator) and [Babbage’s Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) marked significant milestones leading toward the modern computer.\n",

    "Of course, the development of electronic computers was a huge development for science. Prior to that, humans were employed to do the calculations that we now do with computational algorithms. This work occurred in a wide variety of labs where data were entered into tables, calculations were done by hand, and the results were tabulated manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently the work was done by those with less power in the laboratory and broader society (e.g., women, immigrants, and folks of color). A notable and well-known example is the work of the [Harvard Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries where women were employed to do the calculations that led to significant discoveries in astronomy. \n",

    "The algorithms driving modern computing are not neutral—they reflect the biases of the societies that create them. In [Cathy O’Neil’s *Weapons of Math Destruction*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/), the author explores how algorithms used in areas like policing, hiring, and education often reinforce systemic inequality, disproportionately harming marginalized communities. Similarly, [Ruha Benjamin’s *Race After Technology*](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology) examines how race and technology intersect, showing how seemingly “objective” systems encode and perpetuate racial biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of AI in policing is another area of concern. [Simone Browne’s *Dark Matters*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters) highlights how surveillance technologies, from facial recognition to predictive policing, are rooted in practices of racialized social control, extending systems of oppression into the digital realm.\n",

    "The militarization of AI is one of the most alarming developments in computing. AI-driven drones and autonomous weapons, often described as the future of warfare, raise profound ethical and humanitarian concerns.

    "Additionally, [Peter Asaro’s work on lethal autonomous weapons](https://peterasaro.org/writing/Asaro%20Oxford%20AI%20Ethics%20AWS.pdf) questions the morality and legality of machines making life-and-death decisions. Meanwhile, [Kate Crawford’s *Atlas of AI*](https://katecrawford.net/atlas) explores how AI systems, from mining rare earth materials to deployment in warfare, are deeply intertwined with colonial exploitation and ecological destruction.\n",

    "The tech industry's focus on profit has devastating environmental and social impacts. Computing relies on the extraction of rare materials, energy-intensive processes, and exploitative labor practices. [Naomi Klein’s *This Changes Everything*](https://thischangeseverything.org/) examines how capitalism exacerbates climate change, with insights into the environmental toll of computing technologies. [Yarden Katz’s *Artificial Whiteness*](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/artificial-whiteness/9780231194914) connects the development of AI to broader systems of capitalist and racial oppression."
