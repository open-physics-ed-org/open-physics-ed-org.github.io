    "\n",
    "The [Atwood machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwood_machine) consists of two masses, $M$ and $m$, connected by a massless string that passes over a massless pulley. The system is subject to gravity alone. The figure below shows the system along with a choice of coordinates $y_1$ and $y_2$ for the two masses. \n",

    "But notice that $y_1$ and $y_2$ are no independent coordinates. If we unravel the string that is over the pulley, we find that (assume length of string is $l$):\n",

    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the radius of the pulley. That is shown in the figure below.\n",
