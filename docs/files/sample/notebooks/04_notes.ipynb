    "# Week 4 - Notes: Equations of Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed in the last few weeks, our principal work is using models to develop equations of motion. Those equations of motion can then be analyzed, integrated, and plotted to understand the behavior of the system. This week, we will focus on the equations of motion for a few different systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up the equations of motion for a 2D quadratic drag system and show it's intractable analytically. Here is where our use of [Euler-Cromer integration] can get us out of trouble. We will also develop the analytical solution to the 2D drag case when the drag is linear, which will show us how to solve these problems and compare them things we know.We will then quickly introduce two additional systems that are very common \"base models\" for more complex systems: (1) the gravitational bound planet system (a proxy for other central force systems) and (2) the simple harmonic oscillator (a common proxy for many oscillatory systems).\n"

    "## The Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO)\n",

    "$$F = m a_x = m \\dot{v}_x  = m\\ddot{x} = -kx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the equation of motion that we will try to solve is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{x} = -\\dfrac{k}{m}x$$\n",

We can also use these solutions to understand the behavior of more complex systems that can be approximated by the simple harmonic oscillator. \n",

    "One critical aspect of these solutions is that they have 2 free parameters, $A$ and $B$, or $D$ and $\\phi$. These parameters are determined by the initial conditions of the system. **There are N free parameters in the general solution to an Nth order differential equation.**"
